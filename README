SiteCheck 1.1

Born from the necessity of monitoring static html university sites for
changes.

Safes a local copy of each file specified in the sites.txt (one url per line).
And performs a `diff -uw` on this and the previous version to see if there
are any changes. When changes are found the diffs for all sites get mailed
to each address in mails.txt.

Current use case for this script is running it in a cron job to check static
html pages for changes and sending the diffs to a mailing list.

Configuration:
- Set the email that is to be used as the originator in sendmail.py 

- Add sites you want to check to a file sites.txt in this directory in this form:
   name = url
 e.g.
   mathe2 = http://www.exp-mathe.uni-essen.de/mg2

- Add emails to be notified in mails.txt in this directory.

Start SiteCheck.py every time you want the sites checked or as you see fit.
